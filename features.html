The desktop client also archives and encrypts all transferred data (when necessary). During client-server communication (via TCP/IP for the desktop client or HTTP for the Web client), the platform provides guarantee of delivery - it resends any lost requests and ensures that they are processed in the correct order. All these features help the platform run efficiently even on low-bandwidth, unstable, or high-latency communication channels.</p>

In addition, the platform supports access to any external systems at the language level via HTTP, as well as SQL servers, other lsFusion systems, etc. And, since the server itself is implemented as a Spring bean, you can manage its life cycle using a standard Spring IoC container. All these features allow you to use lsFusion not only as a full-fledged development platform, but also as a database or even a Java library.</p>

                <p>The platform can properly roll back the application server to the state it was in before any data transaction had begun. This allows you to use the native integrity tools of modern SQL servers, which not only significantly reduces labor costs and human error when developing a system for a highly concurrent environment, but also makes such a system much more scalable (provided that versioning databases are used).</p>

                <p>The application server runs on a Java virtual machine (JVM) and can thus be integrated with countless Java libraries. To do this, just create your own action in Java, register it in the platform, and then use it just like any action built into the platform or written on the platform's built-in language. Accordingly, you can seamlessly connect custom SQL functions of the database server you're using.</p>

                <p>All elements of the system, from events to form design, are written in the lsFusion language and stored in ordinary text files (without any shared repositories with an unknown structure). This allows you to use popular version control systems (Git, Subversion) and project-building tools (Maven in IDEs) when working with projects. In addition, this approach simplifies the support and deployment of the system you develop - you can use an ordinary text editor to view and quickly modify the logic when necessary and also easily identify any element in the system by file name and line number in this file.</p>

In most cases, you only need to enter the "short" name of the element you're searching for and eventually write more concise and readable code. In addition, you can specify a class for each parameter in the code, and this class will also be taken into account during a search (i.e. explicit types are supported). This also makes your code shorter and simpler and ensures early error detection, smart auto-completion, and lots of other useful features.</p>

                <p>Within any string literal (e.g. an element title or string constant) the platform allows the use of IDs (in brackets) to which you can then assign different texts for different languages. Accordingly, when accessing this literal, the platform automatically localizes it depending on the language settings of the target user.</p>

In addition, the platform allows the simultaneous editing of the same data (e.g. the same document), which is useful for teamwork and rapidly inputting large amounts of data.</p>

                <p>When interacting with a user, the platform can display any data not only as individual objects and lists, but also as trees, both flat ("nested") and recursive (e.g. classifiers). In addition, the platform allows you to group various form blocks into folders (tabs) for structuring large quantities of data. When the data is not visible to the user, it is not read/calculated (e.g. all lists are dynamic by default, i.e. only a limited number of objects are read initially, while the rest of them are read as the current object in the table is changed).</p>
